## Overview of the Project

**Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection**

### Objective

The objective of this project is to build a classification model that detects fraudulent credit card transactions. The model uses anonymized transaction data and applies techniques to deal with class imbalance. The aim is to create a reliable fraud detection system that can differentiate between genuine and fraudulent transactions using metrics like precision and recall.

### Key Activities
- Loaded and analyzed the credit card transaction dataset  
- Performed data normalization and handled class imbalance  
- Trained classification models using Logistic Regression and Random Forest  
- Evaluated the models with precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  
- Applied undersampling/oversampling techniques to improve performance  
- Built a robust pipeline for real-time fraud detection scenarios
